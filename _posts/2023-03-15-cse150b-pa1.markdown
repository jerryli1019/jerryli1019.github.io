In this study, we present a comprehensive approach to pathfinding in a grid world environment. Given a grid with specific terrains such as grass and puddles, our objective is to determine optimal paths from a starting point to a goal. We approach the problem by implementing and evaluating four distinct search algorithms: Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A* Search with Manhattan Distance as the heuristic. The program leverages the PyGame library for visualization and is set up in a Python virtual environment.
