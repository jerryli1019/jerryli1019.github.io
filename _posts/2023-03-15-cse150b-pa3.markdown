This study focuses on the implementation and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms in the game of Blackjack. Utilizing a game engine, based on a simplified version of standard Blackjack rules, this investigation covers three reinforcement learning strategies: Monte Carlo (MC) policy evaluation, Temporal-Difference (TD) policy evaluation, and Q-Learning. The primary objective is to understand the effectiveness of these techniques in deriving an optimal playing strategy.
