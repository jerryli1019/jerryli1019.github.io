The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is implemented to enhance the artificial intelligence of the game Gomoku, a classic board game where players aim to form a line of five pieces of their color. The MCTS not only decides on an action but also provides a table showcasing winning rates for all potential actions. Two primary evaluation metrics are used: one measures the accuracy of the winning rate table and the other pits the AI against a random-play agent.
